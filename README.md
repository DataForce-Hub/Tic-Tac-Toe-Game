README - Tic Tac Toe Game

Project Title:
Tic Tac Toe Game

Description:
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to play the game either on the same computer or via a console interface. The game can be played in a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid, and the first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

Features:

Two-player gameplay.
Dynamic board representation.
Detects winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
Option to restart the game after completion.
Technologies Used:

Python: The game is written in Python.
Console-based UI: The game uses a command-line interface for interaction.
How to Play:

Two players alternate placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.
The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or if all the squares are filled (in which case the game results in a draw).
After the game ends, you can restart by choosing to play again.

Code Structure:

tic_tac_toe: The main game logic and console interface.
board: Contains functions for rendering and updating the game board.
player: Contains the player class and logic to manage turns.
game: Orchestrates the flow of the game (handling turns, detecting wins, etc.).
